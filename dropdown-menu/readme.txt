This dropdown menu was designed with WordPress in mind. WordPress menus are nested ul elements so that is what I here. 

This dropdown menu item was developed in part with the help from a tutorial online, which I unfortunately lost the link and cannot relocate to give due credit. Sorry if that is you, please reach out if you recognize some of the code and setup I will be glad to add your name and link to your post.

I have two dropdown menu styles in this file. Neither are perfect but do provide a starting point.
