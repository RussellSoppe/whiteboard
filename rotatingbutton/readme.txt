This is a readme file, so you can tell us what we need to know.

I am attempting to create something special, a button or element that has some cool rotation animations and or transforms. 

I have been aided greatly so far by other posts on the web including:

partial circle options

This element is far from finished but I wanted to move it to git during it's various iterations.
