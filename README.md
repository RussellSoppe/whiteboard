# whiteboard

My whiteboard is a place to add small snippets of reusable code, I am starting with smaller web elements I can use when building sites. However, who knows what else may find it's way in here. 

If you want to use an element feel free, I just ask that you include a note in the code as to where you got the snippet.

Also if you want to use the template folder as a starting base for your own snippet have at it, enjoy and create some great tools!
